# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. If you want to use the templates to package other extensions, feel free to fork this repository and add them. Pull requests are much appreciated.

Simple version updates are only checked in on important upstream changes. Please leave all templates unexpanded (as `template input` instead of `template begin` and `template and`) to avoid cluttered and redundant code. To ease your work, you may use [makepkg-expanded](https://github.com/dffischer/makepkg-expanded), which can build and distribute the packages without expanding their templates.

The [makepkg-template for git packages](https://github.com/dffischer/git-makepkg-template) are needed to expand all the templates used herein. [Install them globally](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-makepkg-template-git/) or copy them into the [makepkg-templates directory](makepkg-templates) after cloning.
