# Gnome Shell Extension Packages for AUR

This repository collects packages for [extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/) to the [GNOME Shell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell) to globally install them via [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org/)'s [User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/). They are all built and installed in a similar way, so collecting them here eases maintenance as code fragments can be unified and shared among them.
